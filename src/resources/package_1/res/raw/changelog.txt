## Pre‑0.95
# Legacy Performance Issues
Until version 0.94, the app suffered from major performance limitations. Despite significant debugging efforts, the Android canvas and animation APIs couldn't handle the volume of real-time drawing and computation required. 
Even at reduced frame rates (e.g., 24 FPS), the rendering pipeline remained too slow, especially in the main activity. This slow performance was a major drawback that led many users to uninstall the app shortly after launching it.

## Version 0.94
# (Last non OpenGL release)
• Experimental open testing build with minor changes. Later discarded.

## 0.88 - 0.93
• App rework.
• Better perf and stability.
• Bux fixes (Moon, store, other).

# New
• New animations.
• The Sun is now here.
• New scenes: The Celestial Haven and Dunes (to improve).

• Premium version with new scene and fast weather update
• Overall stability improvement

## 0.52
# 2023
Major updates from v0.49!

• New scene: City Scape (Called Monoliths in recent versions).
• The Moon is here! Moonrise/set and phase according to your location
• Shooting stars at night
• planes crossing the sky
• color corrections

# Previously

• corrected minor bugs
• changed weather API
• scene colors rework

## Version Pre 0.52
# No more entries
The 0.52 release notes mention the v0.49, but no entries remain today for earlier versions.
Before the 0.52, the app had a very small user base, around 200 users.
The functions were basic and the performance was poor. No live weather, no Premium version, 2 different scenes (Fuji and Peaks). Very limited scrolling and limited personalisation. The scale of the project was small and no dev logs were made.

I started coding this app for fun, and never thought that more than 10 people would ever download it.
I still have the same mindset, though a little more organized and commited.
It is still a side activity, more a hobby than anything else. Thank you so much for using my app!
