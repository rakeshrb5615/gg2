#How does this app works?
Over the years, and after thousands of hours of work, I’ve turned this simple live wallpaper into a full weather experience, a living, evolving piece of digital art.
To keep improving it and provide real-time weather, I rely on a paid weather provider.
Your contribution helps support the app and ensures it keeps running smoothly.
Thank you for all your feedback and support!

#☀️ The Sun’s Journey
In real life, the Sun follows different paths across the sky depending on your latitude and the season.
The app reflects sunrise and sunset times for your location, so you’ll see the Sun rise and set at the correct hour.
However, to keep the app lightweight, the Sun doesn’t trace the exact arc it would in the real sky.
Instead, it moves in a simplified curve that matches the time of day, helping you sense whether it’s morning, afternoon, or evening.
The Moon follows the same logic.

#🌙 The Moon’s Phases and Appearance
The Moon in the wallpaper shows the real lunar phase, changing from new to full over the month (if the live location is activated).
However, it might not always appear at night.
Why? In reality, the Moon’s position changes daily and can be visible during the day or absent from the night sky depending on its phase and orbit.

#🌳 Wind and Tree Animation
When wind speed increases in your weather data, trees in the scene sway more noticeably.
This animation doesn’t precisely match wind direction or gusts. It’s a visual indicator to give a sense of motion and atmosphere without draining your battery.

#☁️ Clouds and Weather Effects
The app uses layers of vector clouds, rain, or snow depending on your weather. Cloud types and density change with conditions like “partly cloudy” or “overcast.”
Rain and snow animations vary in speed and density but remain subtle to avoid overwhelming the scene.

#🌅 Scene Generation and Organic Growth
All visual elements are drawn by me, but the app is designed to generate scenes procedurally using those assets.
This means elements like trees, hills, or stars are recreated automatically each time a scene is built.
Every instance varies slightly in size, shape, and placement, making the landscape feel more natural and less repetitive.
Instead of showing a single static background, the app constructs the scene dynamically every time it runs. You may notice small differences over days or weeks, even if the weather stays the same.
Yes, every landscape generated by the app is truly unique. I create all the elements, and the code brings them to life.

#✨ Why Some Things Are Simplified
Calculating precise astronomical positions or live sky maps would demand significant processing power and more battery.
Instead, the app balances realism with efficiency, aiming for a beautiful, smooth experience that still feels connected to real-world changes.
