## Q&A
# In case of an issue with the app 
1. Check if your app is up to date (visit the Play Store page).
2. Clear the app storage and cache. 
3. Still not resolved? Send me en email in the contact section. I answer everyone!

# Known Issues
• Home/lock screen limitation: Some devices (like Samsung, Xiaomi) automatically apply live wallpapers to both home and lock screens, even if you select home screen only. Unfortunately, this is a device limitation without an app fix. Apologies for the inconvenience.
• Pixel 10 users: If you notice a particle glitch, set the dimmer to any value above 0.0 to fix it.
• Occasional contrast issues in certain scenes.
• Some instabilities.

#The Set wallpaper button is missing!
It only shows up when the wallpaper is not set.

# Why isn’t the weather updating in real time?
To save battery and data, the app doesn’t constantly check for weather changes.
It updates at regular intervals, from 5 minutes to 5 hours.

# Why doesn’t it snow or rain all the time when it’s snowing or raining outside?
Weather animations only appear when certain conditions are met (like precipitation type, intensity, and daylight).
If your weather source reports “cloudy” instead of “snow,” or if it’s light rain, the app may choose to show clouds for visual clarity.

# Why is sunrise or sunset shifted by about one hour?
This can happen if the weather provider detects a nearby city or region that's in a different time zone, especially near borders.
The app relies on the weather API’s location data for sunrise and sunset times. If that data comes from a weather station in a neighboring region or country with a different time zone, the times may be off by about an hour.
This isn’t a bug in the app but a limitation in how location-based weather data is sometimes matched by external services.

# I think it is draining my battery!
The app is optimized for minimal battery use.
It runs at a reduced frame rate when the scene is not in motion and shuts down when the screen is off. It also uses precomputed elements when possible.
In power saving mode, it further limits animations and updates.
